(They call him Lil' Flip)
I ain't baby but you know I'm big tymin'

Me and Greg Street ridin' in a red Jeep
We doing one-fifty nigga I bet you can't catch me
You gon' respect me-my glock nine protect me
I'm the one on how I'm livin' with the candy Jetski

Elevators in my crib, Barberry in my car
Fire dro' by the jar, burn rubber on the tar
I like to show off, I use to be the class clown
But my teacher always said, "Flip sit you're ass down
Or you can leave the class now"

So I left and got paid
But don't get it twisted I made straight A's
But school didn't pay so I started to rap
'Cause I wanna ride rims, I don't want no hub-caps

So I picked up my pen but I really don't need it
If I ain't in the magazine then I really want read it
I can't be defeated 'cause I'm workin' too hard
Oh my gosh, that boy rims still spinnin' on his car

I ain't baby but you know I'm big tymin'

I get respect on the East, I get respect on the West
Got plenty jewels on my neck, got 22's on my Lex
I'm 22 years old with 22 bad hoes
'Cause real playas get chose if you don't know, now ya know

You know I got crazy flow, and I make crazy dough
'Cause whenever I'm shoppin' I make 'em close down the sto'
(Store)
You know we ballin' for real nigga I'm tellin' the truth
So if I ever go broke, sorry I'm sellin' the coupe

But that ain't gonna happen 'cause I'm a keep on rappin'
And if I keep on grindin', I'm a keep goin' platinum
So people think I'm cappin' but I'm just livin' my life
'Cause I married the streets dogg and that's my wife

(They call him Lil' Flip)
Yep, yep that's my other nickname
(Damn!)
Yep that's my other big chain
(They call him Lil' Flip)

I'm in the hummer you ain't ready for my whip game
Rims so big my adapters won't fit Mayne
Look at my kicks Mayne all of 'em custom
I gotta make it 'cause I can't go back to hustlin'

I'm focused man with no distractions
I'm multiplying money nigga, no subtraction
I'm just relaxing and livin' it up
Nigga you ain't no pimp so give me that cup
